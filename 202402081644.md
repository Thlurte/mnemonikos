In general JavaScript statements are composed of :
- `Values`
- `Operator`
- `Expressions`
- `Keywords`
- `Comments`

Semicolons separate JavaScript statements.
```js
<Enter code here>
```

JavaScript ignores multiple spaces.

```js

```

JavaScript statements can be grouped together in code blocks, inside curly brackets {...}.
