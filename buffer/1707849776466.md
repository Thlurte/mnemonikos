Retrieval Augmented Generation integrates external data retrieval into the generative process, thereby enhancing the model’s ability to provide accurate and relevant responses. [^1]

RAG involves an initial retrieval step where the LLMs query an external data source to obtain relevant information before proceeding to answer questions or generate text. This process not only informs the subsequent generation phase but also ensures that the responses are grounded in retrieved evidence, thereby significantly enhancing the accuracy and relevance of the output. The dynamic retrieval of information from knowledge bases during the inference phase allows RAG to address issues such as the generation of factually incorrect content, commonly referred to as “hallucinations.” [^2]
