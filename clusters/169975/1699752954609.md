## Introduction

Linear equations serve as a fundamental concept in linear algebra, offering a structured way to extract valuable information. Much like systems of sentences discussed earlier, linear equations can be categorized as singular or non-singular based on the amount of information they convey.

## Types of Linear Equations

Linear equations come in various forms, but all adhere to a specific set of rules. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">They involve variables, coefficients, and constants, allowing for the representation of numerical relationships.</mark> Non-linear equations, in contrast, encompass a broader range of mathematical operations, including exponents, trigonometric functions, and logarithms.
