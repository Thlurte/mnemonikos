#+title: Exponentially Weighted Average
Exponentially weighted average algorithm is used to reduce "smooth" the noice in a nosiy time-series data. It is achieved by weighing the number of observations and using their average.

$$
W_1=\beta\cdot W_0 + (1-\beta)\cdot \theta_1
$$

Also to compute the EWA for a given weight parameter $\beta$ we use :

\begin{align}
W_t=
\begin{cases}
0 & t=0 \\
\beta \cdot W_{t-1}+(1-\beta) \cdot \theta_t & t>0 \\
\end{cases}
\end{align}

In this case with a given data :

| Weekday   | Temprature |
| Sunday    |         25 |
| Monday    |         28 |
| Tuesday   |         26 |
| Wednesday |         22 |
| Thursday  |         19 |
| Friday    |         23 |
| Saturday  |         27 |

For this example, let's suppose that $\beta=0.9$, so the EWA aims to combine the temperature of the current day with the previous tempratures.

| Temprature | EWMA                         |
|         25 | 0.9*0 + (1-0.9)*25           |
|         28 | 0.9* (1-0.9)*25 + (1-0.9)*28 |
|            |                              |

Based on the calculations we can conclude that the given formula would be like this :

\begin{align}
W_t=(1-\beta)\sum^t_{i=0} \beta^{t-i}\theta_i
\end{align}
