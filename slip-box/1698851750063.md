so there are few points i learned througout the whole evening

if i were to print a statement using cpp it would look like this

```cpp
#include<iostream>

int main(){
	std::cout << "Hello World";
	
	return 0;
}
```


so to declare variables i can do it like this

```cpp
#include<iostream>

int main(){
int meow;
int wow;
int cow;
std::string mow;

return 0;
}
```


to store values in with these variables i can

```cpp
#include<iostream>

int main(){
	int age = 23;
}
```

now lets talk about each and every data types shall we


```cpp
#include<iostream>

int main(){
	//int would look like this
	int age = 15;
	// int would truncate any fractional value for example
	int ager = 15.5;

	//if we were to print this
	std::cout << ager
	// output of this particular line would be 15 not 15.5
	
	//lets talk about double
	double marks = 15.5;
	
	//now about boolean
	bool isRegisterd = false;
	bool isMale = true;
	char value = 'A';
	// string could be stored in the following way
	std::string meow = "Meowww"
}
```

so i learned that single quotation is for char type and double quotation is for string.

now lets talk about const, const help us prevent anyone from modifying a variable

```cpp
#include<iostream>

int main(){
	const int PI = 3.145;
	const int WIDTH = 1290;
}
```

namespaces are a new concept where we store different values for a variable in different namespaces, i mean could be demonstrated in the following way,

```cpp
#include<iostream>
namespace first{
	int x = 5;
}
namespace second{
	double x = 6.66;
}

int main(){
	int x = 0;
	/* to print the number in the current namespace i can just use it in the usual way
	*/
	std::cout << x;
	
	// on the other hand to use the variable x from first namespace i can
	std::cout << first::x;
	
	//just i did earlier to access the second namespace i can
	std::cout << second::x;
	
	return 0;
}
```

instead i can also

```cpp
#include<iostream>
namespace first{
	int x = 5;
}
namespace second{
	double x = 6.66;
}
int main(){
	using namespace first;
	std::cout << x;
}
```

we can use `using namespace std;` to avoid the precursor `std` that we type every single time calling specific entity.

also we can

```cpp
#include<iostream>
int main(){
	using std::string;
	using std::cout;
	int x = 10;
	// int this case we can just print the number using cout like this
	cout << x;
}
```
