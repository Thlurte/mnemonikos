## typedef

this is a reserved keyword used to create an additional alias for another data type,
- helps make the code more readable and reduces typos
- `_t` is a common convention in creating additional alias

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

typedef std::vector<std::pair<std::string,int>> pairlist_t;
typedef std::string test_t;
typedef int meouw;

int main(){
	// instead of storing a value like this i can use the alias
    std::string sound = "meow";
    // like this
    test_t soundd =  "meow";
    
    // some other implementation for more example
    meouw crazynumber = 5;
     
    return 0;
}
```

nowadays `typedef` has been largely replaced by `using` keyword which works better with `w/ templates`.

for example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using text_t = std::string;
using number_t = int;
int main(){
    text_t name = "lisa";
    number_t number = 5;
    std::cout << name;
    std::cout << number;
    return 0;
}
```

## arithmatic operators

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using text_t = std::string;
using number_t = int;
int main(){
    // addition
    int student = 20;    // 20 
    student = student + 1; // 21
    student+=1; // 22 shorthand for addtion
    student++; // 23 increment operator
    std::cout << student << "\n";

    //subtraction
    student = student -1;
    student-=1;
    student--;
    std::cout << student << "\n";

    // multiplication
    student = student*2;
    student*=2;
    std::cout << student << "\n";

    //division
    student = student /2;
    student/=2;

    std::cout << student << "\n";
    
    
    // modulus operator
	int num = 15;
	std::cout << num% 3; // 0
	std::cout << num%4; // 3


}
```

## type conversion

this is a way to convert value of one data type to another, there are two ways to convert them like
- implicity (defined automatically)
- explicit (where we specify a value with new data type)

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main(){
    // addition
    int x = 3.14;
    double y = 3.14;

    std::cout << x <<std::endl;
    std::cout << (int)y <<std::endl;

    char c = 100;
    std::cout << c << '\n';
    std::cout << (char)100 << '\n';

    int correct = 8;
    int questions = 10;
    
    std::cout << correct/questions * 100 << "%" << '\n'; // 0%
    std::cout << (double)correct/questions * 100 << "%" << '\n'; // 80%
    std::cout << correct/(double)questions * 100 << "%" << '\n'; // 80%
    std::cout << (double)(correct/questions) * 100 << "%" << '\n'; // 0%

}
```

## User Inputs

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main(){
    //cin >> (extraction operator)
    std::string name;
    int age;

    std::cout << "Atleast tell us your name..";
    std::cin >> name;


    std::cout << "Then tell us your age..";
    std::cin >> age;


    std::cout << "Your name is " << name << " Right? " << '\n';
    std::cout << "You are " << age << " old right?";

}
```

there is a problem with `cin << variable`, it is that it wont take text that were typed after space in a given input

i mean when i pass value as `Jhon Doe` in this case, it becomes two distinct values and get passed into `name` and `age`. 

to fix this issue we can use `std::getline()` method.

```cpp
int main(){
    //cin >> (extraction operator)
    std::string name;
    int age;

    std::cout << "Atleast tell us your name..";
    std::getline(std::cin, name);


    std::cout << "Then tell us your age..";
    std::cin >> age;


    std::cout << "Your name is " << name << " Right? " << '\n';
    std::cout << "You are " << age << " old right?";

}
```

i also came across an issue, where i changed the `std::cin`'s  position above `std::getline` this caused a problem, 

by problem i mean whenever i pass values into `std::cin` in the first place, it automatically skipped passing values into `std::getline`. 

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main(){
    //cin >> (extraction operator)
    std::string name;
    int age;

    std::cout << "Then tell us your age..";
    std::cin >> age;

    std::cout << "Atleast tell us your name..";
    std::getline(std::cin >> std::ws, name);


    std::cout << "Your name is " << name << " Right? " << '\n';
    std::cout << "You are " << age << " old right?";

}
```

that could be solved with `std::ws`.
