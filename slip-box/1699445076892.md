## do while loop
this is where we allow the program to do some block of code first and then repeat again if condition is true.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main(){
    int number;

    do{
        std::cout << "Enter a positive #: ";
        std::cin >> number;
    }while(number < 0);

    std::cout << "This # is: " << number;
    return 0;
}
```
