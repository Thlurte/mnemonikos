# Nervous System

The nervous system is a complex network of cells and tissues that <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">transmit signals between different parts of the body.</mark> It is divided into two main parts: the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS).

## Anatomy of Nervous System

### Axes:
**1. Sagittal Axis:**

- Runs from front to back, dividing the body into left and right halves.
- Movements around this axis involve rotation and are described as either flexion or extension.

**2. Frontal (Coronal) Axis:**

- Runs from side to side, dividing the body into front and back halves.
- Movements around this axis include abduction (moving away from the midline) and adduction (moving toward the midline).

**3. Vertical (Longitudinal) Axis:**

- Runs from top to bottom, through the body.
- Movements around this axis involve rotation and are described as either medial rotation (toward the midline) or lateral rotation (away from the midline).


### Planes:

**1. Sagittal Plane:**

- Divides the body into left and right sections.
- Movements within this plane include flexion (bending) and extension (straightening).

**2. Frontal (Coronal) Plane:**

- Divides the body into front and back sections.
- Movements within this plane include abduction (moving away from the midline) and adduction (moving toward the midline).

**3. Transverse (Horizontal) Plane:**

- Divides the body into upper and lower sections.
- Movements within this plane include rotation, such as medial rotation (toward the midline) and lateral rotation (away from the midline).

### Other Terminologies
**Superior and Inferior**
Subject to the anatomical position, the cranium is superior and the feet are inferior.
**Anterior and Posterior**
"Rostral" is anterior and "caudal" is posterior.
**Medialis and Lateralis**
Subject to the median line, the proximal part is medialis and the distal part is lateralis.
**Inferior and Exterior**
To describe relative spatial relationships of specific structures and cavities.
**Superficial and Deep**
Subject ti the body surface, the proximal part is superficial and the distal part is deep.

## Central Nervous System

- **Brain:** The brain is the central organ of the nervous system and is responsible for processing and interpreting information received from the sensory organs, as well as for initiating responses.

> The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a highly selective and protective barrier that separates the circulating blood from the brain's extracellular fluid.

- **Spinal Cord:** The spinal cord is a long, tubular structure that extends from the brainstem and is protected by the vertebral column. It serves as a pathway for nerve signals traveling to and from the brain and peripheral nerves.
