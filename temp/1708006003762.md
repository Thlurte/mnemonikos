A network architecture based on attention mechanism.

### Input Embeddings
Here learned embeddings are used to convert the input tokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension $d_{model}$ and weights are multiplied by $\sqrt{d_{model}}$ .

### Positional Encoding
To provide some information about the relative or absolute position of the tokens in the sequence "positional encodings" are added to the input embeddings at the bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks.

The positional encodings have the same dimension $d_{model}$ as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed.

> Denominator is calculated in log space.

Sine and cosine functions of different frequencies are used:

$$
PE_{(pos,2i)}=\sin(pos/10000^{2i/d_{model}}) \\
$$
$$
PE_{(pos,2i+1)}=\cos(pos/10000^{2i/d_{model}}) \\
$$
In the input vector sine function is applied to the even positions and cos is applied to the odd positions.

### Layer Normalization
This is where mean and variance are calculated independently for each batch and new value is calculated for each of them, Also **gamma** and **beta** are introduced to provide some fluctuation in the data. 

$$
\hat{x_{j}}=\frac{x_{j}-\mu_{j}}{\sqrt{\sigma^2_{j}+\epsilon}}
$$
